# 🧮 Calculator Project (Java Console Application)

## 🧠 Project Overview
This is a **Java-based console calculator** that performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo.  
It allows the user to perform **continuous operations** on multiple numbers interactively.  

The project demonstrates:
- Handling user input using `Scanner`
- Implementing arithmetic operations using `switch` statements
- Applying input validation (for invalid operators and divide-by-zero cases)
- Using loops and conditionals effectively in Java

## ⚙️ Features
✅ Supports basic arithmetic operations — `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`  
✅ Accepts multiple numbers and performs sequential operations  
✅ Handles invalid operator inputs gracefully  
✅ Prevents division or modulo by zero  
✅ Displays the **final computed result** after all operations

## 🧩 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Java  
- **Version:** JDK 8 or above  
- **IDE Recommended:** Eclipse / IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code  
- **Libraries Used:** None (pure Java)

## 🖥️ How It Works
1. The user specifies the number of values to calculate.  
2. The program takes the first number as the base value.  
3. For each subsequent number, the user provides an operator and a number.  
4. The result is updated after every operation.  
5. At the end, the **final result** is displayed.
